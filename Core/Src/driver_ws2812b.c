/**
 * @brief  Initializes the WS2812B LED control system.
 * @retval HAL_StatusTypeDef: Returns the status of the initialization process.
 *         - `HAL_OK`: The initialization was successful.
 *         - Other `HAL_StatusTypeDef` values indicate a failure during
 *           initialization.
 *
 * - PWM Timer Initialization: Calls `HAL_TIM_PWM_Init()` to initialize the PWM
 *   timer (`WS2812B_TIM`). This timer is used to generate the PWM signals
 *   necessary for controlling the WS2812B LEDs.
 *
 * - DMA Buffer Clearing: Clears the `WS2812B_DMA_BUF` by setting all elements
 *   to 0. This ensures that the DMA buffer starts in a known state, preventing
 *   any unintended signals from being sent to the LEDs during the first update.
 *
 * - DMA Ready Flag: Sets the `WS2812B_DMA_COMPLETE_FLAG` to 1, indicating that
 *   the system is ready for a DMA transfer. This flag is crucial for
 *   synchronizing updates to the LEDs, ensuring that data is only sent when the
 *   system is ready.
 *
 * Implementation Notes:
 * - Ensure that `WS2812B_TIM` is properly configured and that the
 *   `WS2812B_DMA_BUF_LEN` is correct for the number of LEDs (`LED_COUNT`) and
 *   the bits per LED (`WS2812B_BITS_PER_LED`).
 * - The function should be called during system initialization before any
 *   attempts to update the LEDs.
 *
 * Potential Issues:
 * - If `HAL_TIM_PWM_Init()` fails, the function will return an error code, and
 *   the LED system will not be able to operate correctly.
 * - The DMA buffer must be properly sized using the `WS2812B_DMA_BUF_LEN` macro
 *   to prevent data corruption or timing issues.

/**
 * @brief  Updates the WS2812B LEDs with the latest color data.
 * @retval HAL_StatusTypeDef: Returns the status of the operation.
 *         - `HAL_OK`: The DMA transfer started successfully.
 *         - `HAL_BUSY`: The previous DMA transfer is still in progress.
 *
 * - DMA Completion Check: First, it checks if the previous DMA transfer has
 *   completed by checking the `WS2812B_DMA_COMPLETE_FLAG`. If the flag is not
 *   set, indicating that the previous transfer is still ongoing, the function
 *   returns `HAL_BUSY` without starting a new transfer.
 *
 * - Data Preparation: If the DMA is ready, the function then prepares the data
 *   for each LED by iterating through the `WS2812B_LED_DATA` array. For each
 *   LED, it calculates the corresponding bits and updates the DMA buffer
 *   (`WS2812B_DMA_BUF`) with the appropriate duty cycle values
 *   (`WS2812B_HI_VAL_DUTY` for a high bit, `WS2812B_LO_VAL_DUTY` for a low
 *   bit).
 *
 * - DMA Transfer Start: After preparing the data, the function attempts to
 *   start a new DMA transfer using `HAL_TIM_PWM_Start_DMA()`. If the transfer
 *   is started successfully, the `WS2812B_DMA_COMPLETE_FLAG` is cleared,
 *   signaling that a new transfer is in progress.
 *
 * Implementation Notes:
 * - The function assumes that the DMA buffer has been initialized correctly by
 *   `WS2812B_Init()`.
 * - The reset condition of the LEDs is handled by the initialization routine,
 *   so no additional steps are required here.
